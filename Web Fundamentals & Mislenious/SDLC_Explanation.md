# What is SDLC?

**SDLC** stands for **Software Development Life Cycle**.

It’s a structured process or framework used by developers and project managers to **plan, create, test, and deploy** software applications.

Think of it as a step-by-step **roadmap** to build software efficiently and with quality.

## 📌 Why is SDLC Used?

- ✅ **To ensure quality**: Helps produce high-quality software that meets customer expectations.
- 💰 **To manage time and cost**: Helps plan and control project schedule and budget.
- ⚠️ **To reduce risks**: Detect and resolve issues early in development.
- 📋 **To improve project management**: Clear phases and deliverables at each step.
- 📝 **To provide documentation**: Useful for maintenance and future upgrades.

## 🔄 Common Phases in SDLC

1. **Requirement Gathering and Analysis**  
   - Understand what the client or users need from the software.

2. **Planning**  
   - Set timelines, resources, and check feasibility.

3. **Design**  
   - Create architecture, system models, and design documents.

4. **Implementation / Coding**  
   - Write the actual code (this is where your .NET Core skills come in!).

5. **Testing**  
   - Check for bugs and ensure the software works as expected.

6. **Deployment**  
   - Release the software to the production environment.

7. **Maintenance**  
   - Fix bugs and update the software after it goes live.
