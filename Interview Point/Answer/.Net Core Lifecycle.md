# ASP.NET Core Request Processing Flow

## 1. Browser Sends a Request
Example: You type: https://myapp.com/home

```yaml
- This request goes to the **Kestrel** web server (built-in server in .NET Core).
```
---

## 2. Kestrel Receives the Request
- Kestrel is the **entry point** for all requests.  
- It passes the request into the **ASP.NET Core pipeline**.

---

## 3. Middleware Pipeline
- **Middleware** = Small programs that handle requests in sequence.

### Examples:
- **Exception Handling Middleware** – catches errors.  
- **Routing Middleware** – decides which controller or page to call.  
- **Authentication Middleware** – checks if the user is logged in.  

Configured in:
- `Startup.cs` (ASP.NET Core 3.x and earlier)  
- `Program.cs` (.NET 6+)  

---

## 4. Routing
- Based on the URL, .NET Core matches the request to the **controller** and **action**.  
Example:
/home/index → HomeController → Index() method

---

## 5. Controller Executes
- The controller takes the request and interacts with:
  - **Services**
  - **Database** (e.g., EF Core)

Example:
```csharp
var data = _context.Users.ToList();
```

## 6. Action Result
The controller returns a result such as:

- HTML View

- JSON Data (API)

- File

- Redirect

## 7. Response Sent Back
- The result goes back through the middleware (outgoing path)

- → Kestrel

- → Browser displays the page/data.

Visual Flow
```markdown

Browser → Kestrel → Middleware → Routing → Controller 
        → Service/DB → Action Result → Middleware → Kestrel → Browser
```

## Summery- 
- Kestrel = Web server that handles requests.

- Middleware = Step-by-step request processing.

- Routing = Finds the correct controller/action.

- Controller = Main logic handler.

- Action Result = The final output sent to the user.
