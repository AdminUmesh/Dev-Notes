**HTTP request in .Net Core MVC**

**is all request passed through program.cs files**

**How Can configue and use Http client**

**About Start.cs file or Program.cs files**

# What is Pipeline, Services and Middleware ?

## Pipeline

The pipeline itself is essentially the sequence of these middleware components. When a request is received by the application, it enters the pipeline at the top and is processed by each middleware in the order they were added.

`The request pipeline is represented by the series of middleware configurations that are added with the app.Use... methods and the app.Map... method.`

## Middleware

Middleware is code that processes HTTP requests as they come in and HTTP responses as they go out. Middleware components are executed in the order they are added to the pipeline.

**Example**
 Middleware components can perform tasks such as logging, exception handling, authentication, authorization, serving static files, and more.

 ```c#
 // All below starting with app.Use are middlewares
app.UseRouting()
app.UseAuthentication()
app.UseSession()
app.UseHttpsRedirection()
 ```

 ## Services
 In ASP.NET Core, services are components that are used to perform specific tasks in your application, such as managing authentication, handling sessions, logging, and more. 

 `These services are registered in the dependency injection container, and you can access them throughout the application via constructor injection.`

 ```C#
 // all below starting with builder.Services.Add is Services

 // this is a Service
 builder.Services.AddAuthentication("Cookies")
    .AddCookie(options =>
    {
        options.Cookie.HttpOnly = true;
        options.Cookie.IsEssential = true;  
        options.LoginPath = "/Account/Login";
        options.LogoutPath = "/Account/Logout";
        options.ExpireTimeSpan = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30);
    });

// this is another service
    builder.Services.AddSession(options =>
{
    options.IdleTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30); // Set session timeout
});

// this is also a service
builder.Services.AddDistributedMemoryCache(); // To store session in memory
```

## Relationship between Services and Middleware
Middleware and Services Are Part of the Request-Response Pipeline:

## Can Middleware Work Without a Service?

Yes, some simple middleware can work without relying on any services. These middlewares are typically static in nature and do not require dynamic configuration or interaction with other application components.

**Example**
- Static File Middleware
```c#
app.UseStaticFiles();

//This middleware serves static files (like images, CSS, JS) from the wwwroot directory.
```

 - HTTPS Redirection Middleware

 ```c#
 app.UseHttpsRedirection();

 // his middleware simply redirects HTTP requests to HTTPS.
 ```

## Can Services Work Without a Middleware?
Yes, many services can work independently of middleware, particularly background services, data access services, and other infrastructure-related services that donâ€™t directly interact with the HTTP request pipeline.

**Examples of Services That Can Work Without Middleware**

1. DbContext (or other database services) can be used independently from middleware. You can inject and use services like DbContext into controllers.

```c#
public class HomeController : Controller
{
    private readonly MyDbContext _dbContext;
    public HomeController(MyDbContext dbContext)
    {
        _dbContext = dbContext;
    }

    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        var data = _dbContext.Users.ToList();
        return View(data);
    }
}
```
