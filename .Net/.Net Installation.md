## 2. Which Visual Studio should Install

### Based on Project / Target Framework

| Project Type / .NET Version | Visual Studio to Install |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------|
| .NET Framework 4.5 – 4.8 | VS 2019 ✅ or VS 2022 ✅ |
| .NET 5 | VS 2019 ✅ (last supported) |
| .NET 6 | VS 2022 ✅ |
| .NET 7 | VS 2022 ✅ |
| .NET 8 (LTS) | VS 2022 ✅ (Recommended) |
| .NET 9 | VS 2022 ✅ |
| .NET 10 (future) | VS 2022 (updated) ✅ |
| Legacy WinForms / WPF (.NET Framework) | VS 2019 / VS 2022 |

### Simple Rule
- **Old / Legacy projects** → VS 2019  
- **Modern & new projects** → **VS 2022 (always)**

---

## 3. Differences Between VS 2019 and VS 2022

| Feature | VS 2019 | VS 2022 |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Architecture | 32-bit | **64-bit** |
| Max .NET support | .NET 5 | .NET 6 → .NET 10 |
| Performance | Limited (RAM bound) | Much faster |
| Large solutions | ❌ Struggles | ✅ Handles easily |
| Recommended today | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

---

## 4. Install Visual Studio 2022 (Recommended)

### Download
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

Choose:
- **Visual Studio 2022 (Community / Professional / Enterprise)**

Restart Windows after installation.

---

## 5. Install .NET SDK

### What is SDK?
- SDK = **Build + Run + CLI tools**
- Runtime alone is **NOT sufficient** for development

### Download SDKs
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download


## 6. How to Check SDK is Installed or Not

Open **Command Prompt**:
```cmd
dotnet --list-sdks
```

Example output:
```
8.0.204
10.0.102
```

If nothing shows:
- SDK not installed
- Or wrong architecture (x86)

### Check current SDK in use
```cmd
dotnet --version
```

---

## 7. SDK Folder Location (Important)

| Architecture | Location |
|-------------|----------|
| x64 | C:\Program Files\dotnet\sdk |
| x86 | C:\Program Files (x86)\dotnet\sdk |

Visual Studio **uses x64 only**.

---

## 8. Local HTTPS / SSL Certificate (ASP.NET Core)

ASP.NET Core uses HTTPS by default for local development.

### Why HTTPS is Needed
- Secure cookies
- Authentication
- Browser security
- Modern API standards

### Trust HTTPS Developer Certificate
Run **CMD as Administrator**:
```cmd
dotnet dev-certs https --clean
dotnet dev-certs https --trust
```

✔ Click **Yes** when Windows asks for trust

This prevents:
- “Unable to connect to web server https”
- Browser SSL warnings

---

## 9. When HTTPS Certificate Popup Appears
You may see:
```
Trust ASP.NET Core HTTPS development certificate?
```

✔ Always click **YES**  
It is safe and local-only.
