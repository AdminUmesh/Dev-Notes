# Scaffolding
Scaffolding a DbContext in .NET Core is a process used to generate entity classes and a DbContext class based on an existing database schema. This is particularly useful when you want to work with an existing database using Entity Framework Core (EF Core). 

## Required Tools:
**Before scaffolding, you need to install the necessary tools and packages:**

```powershell
# first Using the Package Manager Console
dotnet add package Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql
# second Using the Package Manager Console
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
```

## Command Usage:
**The basic command structure for scaffolding is:**

```powershell
Scaffold-DbContext "Server=localhost;User ID=root;Password=admin@123;Database=csatcloud_id" MySql.EntityFrameworkCore -OutputDir Models -f -Context CsatcloudTestingContext
```

# Migrations
Migrations, on the other hand, are a way to manage changes to your database schema over time. When you modify your model (e.g., adding a new property or creating a new entity), migrations help you apply these changes to the database. Hereâ€™s how it works:

**Add Migration:** When you create a migration, EF Core generates a set of instructions (in code) that describe how to transform the current database schema to match your updated model.

```powershell
# Using the Package Manager Console
Add-Migration MigrationName
```

**Update Database:** You then apply these migrations to the database, which updates its schema without losing existing data.

```powershell
# Using the Package Manager Console
Update-Database
```
