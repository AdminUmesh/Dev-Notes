# Angular Lifecycle Hooks

Angular provides lifecycle hooks that allow you to tap into key events in the lifecycle of a component or directive.

## List of Lifecycle Hooks

| Hook | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `ngOnChanges()` | Called before `ngOnInit()` and whenever one or more data-bound input properties change. |
| `ngOnInit()` | Called once upon initialization of the component. |
| `ngDoCheck()` | Called during every change detection run. |
| `ngAfterContentInit()` | Called after `ngOnInit()` when content (ng-content) has been projected into view. |
| `ngAfterContentChecked()` | Called after every check of projected content. |
| `ngAfterViewInit()` | Called after the component's view and child views are initialized. |
| `ngAfterViewChecked()` | Called after the component's view and child views are checked. |
| `ngOnDestroy()` | Called right before Angular destroys the component. Useful for cleanup. |

## Hook Usage Examples

### `ngOnInit`

```typescript
export class MyComponent implements OnInit {
  ngOnInit() {
    console.log('Component initialized');
  }
}
```

### `ngOnChanges`

```typescript
export class MyComponent implements OnChanges {
  @Input() data: string;

  ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges) {
    console.log('Data changed:', changes);
  }
}
```

### `ngOnDestroy`

```typescript
export class MyComponent implements OnDestroy {
  ngOnDestroy() {
    console.log('Component destroyed');
  }
}
```

## Lifecycle Hook Order

1. `ngOnChanges`
2. `ngOnInit`
3. `ngDoCheck`
4. `ngAfterContentInit`
5. `ngAfterContentChecked`

7. `ngAfterViewChecked`
8. `ngOnDestroy`

## Conclusion

Lifecycle hooks give developers the ability to run logic at critical moments in a component's life, allowing better control over data, rendering, and cleanup. Use them wisely for initializing data, subscribing/unsubscribing services, and managing UI updates.
