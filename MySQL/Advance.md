## SQL Server User-defined Functions

- scalar functions
The scalar functions help you simplify your code. For example, you may have a complex calculation that appears in many queries. Instead of including the formula in every query, you can create a scalar function that encapsulates the formula and uses it in each query.

- Creating a scalar function

To create a scalar function, you use the CREATE FUNCTION statement as follows:
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION [schema_name.]function_name (parameter_list)
RETURNS data_type AS
BEGIN
    statements
    RETURN value
END
```
